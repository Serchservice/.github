## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

Serch is a startup company on the verge of creating the best technology for comfortability. All about Serch is embedded on the ideology of comfortability, because man cannot make money and end up not enjoying it all in a more comfortable manner.

Therefore, Serch sells comfortability to the people, with added exclusivity, security and more wonderful features to speed up comfortable living. In all that, Serch still invests more on its user's experience and privacy.
